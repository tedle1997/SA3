            <h2>A compile of reviews on my favorite movie</h2>
            <p><b>Blade Runner 2049</b> is wholesome enough for me to consider
                watching it again and again for nearly 5 times while its in the cinema.
                Nowadays when I run out of things to watch I either rewatch 
                <b>The Big Short</b> or <b>Blade Runner 2049</b>. Here are the noteable
                reviews of the movie.

            <h2>Variety's Film Review: ‘Blade Runner 2049’</h2>
            <h4>By PETER DEBRUGE SEPTEMBER 29, 2017</h4>

                The world as we know it has nearly caught up to the one Ridley Scott 
                imagined when he directed the 2019-set “Blade Runner,” and yet, for 
                all the influence the dystopian cult favorite has had on other sci-fi 
                movies, Scott’s vision of Los Angeles still looks as mind-blowingly 
                futuristic now as it did in 1982. That may well explain why its sequel, 
                the Denis Villeneuve-directed “Blade Runner 2049,” doesn’t feel the need 
                to reinvent the world in which it takes place, but instead is free to 
                delve deep into the existential concerns suggested by the earlier film, 
                as screenwriters Hampton Fancher (who also co-wrote the original) and 
                Michael Green raise evocative questions about human-android relations 
                and the nuances that will one day be used to tell them apart.
